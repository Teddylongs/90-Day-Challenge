John 1:47 - 'As they approached, Jesus said, &quot;Now here is a genuine son of Israel-a man of complete integrity.&quot;' This was after Nathanael already said &quot;Can anything good come from Nazareth?&quot;. After reading John 3:17 and John 3:21, I saw how Jesus welcomes us when we come to the light (to Him) even if we have already sinned. It was a nice reminder that Jesus wants us to come to Him in that, Nathanael had just expressed doubt about Jesus, but the first thing Jesus said was not &quot;God punish you for not believing in Me&quot;"

He said Jesus must become greater and greater and he (John) must become less and less. It's a sign of total surrender. Giving Jesus room in your life can only make him greater and greater in your life and the affairs of your life. It does not matter how great a situation may appear to be, surrendering it to God makes it become less and less and Jesus greater and greater in that situation.

Ope.elesin@gmail.com,1610977512,Thu Jan 21 2021 15:43:02 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),For me what stood out for me was John‚Äôs humility. He was like a ‚Äúmessenger‚Äù.  He was to prepare the way and he did it well.  He could have chosen not to but he kept saying he is not the messiah.  It teaches us that whatever assignment God has for us we should do it excellently in order to fulfill our destiny as John did. He also had the clarity of vision.

When people see me, do they see the glory of God ? Does my life inspire others to believe in God?
There is no doubt that I experience the miraculous, as being alive is a miracle. But do I expressively attribute all credit and glory to God, for others to see and to understand the source?"
egbutachinaza@gmail.com,1610977121,Thu Jan 21 2021 15:43:02 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),"We just have to love the audacity of Jesus üôÇüôåüèΩ.  

I‚Äôve read John several times but today, I found it curious that Jesus used the stone jars used for the ‚ÄúJewish Ritual of Purification‚Äù for the miracle of turning water to wine.  

This ritual of purification is central to Jewish tradition.  The ‚ÄúLaw‚Äù / ‚ÄúTorah‚Äù (of the Old Testament), commanded cleansing with water for physical and spiritual purification.  We all know that cleanliness is both a prerequisite of holiness and an aid to physical fitness / hygiene.  

But why did Jesus use these ceremonial stone jars?

He asked them to fill the jars with ‚Äúwater‚Äù (John 6:7).  

Two things came to my mind here:

1.) Water refreshes dryness and water brings life.  Water was (and still is) recognized for natural cleansing.  To the Jews at that time, water coming from their ceremonial cleansing jars had to be for their cleansing ritual - which occurred on the outside.  By turning the ‚Äúwater‚Äù from the ceremonial cleansing jars into ‚Äúwine‚Äù (which is a symbol for the Holy Spirit according to Ephesians 5:18), Jesus was trying to show them (and show us) a new way.  Jesus changes the water - which washes the outer body, into the wine of the Spirit - which cleanses and regenerates internally. Jesus uses this miracle to teach us that the work of ceremonial cleansing with water could only go so far, and at best remain superficial.  But the work of cleansing by the wine of the Holy Spirit launches us to a new way of life.  Remember, John the Baptist said he baptized with water (ceremonial / traditional cleansing) but Jesus was going to baptize with the Holy Spirit (new wine) and fire.  


2.) This work of the Holy Spirit is symbolized literally to us, as new wine coming into old earthen vessels.  

This led to a bunch of questions for me:

a.) If the new wine symbolizes the (work of) Holy Spirit, then it cannot stay closed in a vessel.  Despite how significant (ceremonial) or pretty the vessel is, the new wine is useless if it is not poured out to others.  The new wine in my life must be shared to fill a void / need in the lives of everyone I encounter.  The work of the Holy Spirit must me manifest in my life. 

b.) If there is new wine, then new wine skins are needed.  The former way of doing things must change.  What am I doing on my part to ensure that this new wine does not remain in an old vessel? What steps am I taking to transition to the new level of holiness, prayerfulness, worship, service, giving? What new approaches to my faith walk, personal life, career, relationships does God want me to embrace in 2021 and beyond?"
pelumi.ola16@gmail.com,1610976992,Thu Jan 21 2021 15:43:02 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),I really enjoyed chapter 1. I found it very ingesting that at every point John reminded the people that he is not the Messiah he is just here to make the path.

japhethbalogun@outlook.com,1610976944,Thu Jan 21 2021 15:43:02 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),"John 2:7 was what stood out to me when I was reading my bible, When Jesus told the servants to fill the water jars during the wedding at Cana, Galilee he did not tell them where to fill them up to, but the servants filled them up to the brim even though they could have filled them halfway. It means that we determine how much we want God to bless us, whether it is halfway or fully to the brim."

It was available but wine was not available or accessible.
&quot;Despise not the days of small beginnings&quot;. Because if we can be faithful while our handling water, it might just be our wine.
There's something in the process of being committed to our vision when it looks like is nothing happening. and the devil is saying &quot;Where is your God? I thought you asked God for wine, I thought God was goning do something? What good is it to just to have water?&quot;
It might still look like its water, but trust that God is a miracle working God. Keep in faith and dont doubt God and what looks like water right now can be the wine we were praying for."

Reflection: 

The disciples knew the scripture but didn't believe it nor take it to heart until after Jesus rose from the dead.
Sometimes we honestly do need a close up personal experience to actually believe.
Then the words become personalized and then without doubt becomes alive in us.

1. Not everyone will like you or what you do though you are anointed

3. Stay focus on your calling and those God has assigned to believe in you and called you to.

4. Jesus was rejected and he handled it well, it‚Äôs no big deal if you experience same.

John the Baptist initially did not until he saw the Holy Spirit rest upon Jesus, and neither did Nathaniel until he spent some time with Jesus.

John 1- The Ministry of Jesus

The power of recognition John recognized the spirit on Jesus and this was clear that he was a man with the word of God.

Secondly phillip testimony when speaking to Nathanael about Jesus he spoke concerning the words of the prophets. He knew and believed the word hence believing Jesus was easy.

Summary what the Holy spirit is saying to me is continue studying the word to understand and recognize events.

John 2- 

Miracles are possible even when it's not time as seen in the wedding at Cana.
When we stay with Jesus it brings us to a place of early strange miracles. 

Mediating on the temple of the Lord, Jesus destroyed all selling and buying activities. As hes children we have the power of Attorney to use his name to stop any unpleasant circumstances.

The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom‚Äôs voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.

This is how our growth in faith should be - should be like a nosedive into the fullness of God. No delay.

John 1:35-39. Andrew and Simon Peter were the first set of disciple that followed Jesus. This was so because they were with John the Baptist already and heard him say ... ‚ÄúBehold the Lamb of God‚Äù. 
Watch what you hear and whom you keep friends with. PWA said to grow in faith you need to Hear, Consider and Comprehend. I believe these played a part in the disciples following Jesus.

Takinsiku@yahoo.com,1610947738,Thu Jan 21 2021 15:43:02 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),John 1: 4 Not one thing in all creation was made without Jesus. Jesus is at the Center of it all. He is at the Center of our lives. Jesus is the source and sustainer of life that brings light/ revelation to every born again child of God. You can never walk in darkness or Confusion when you have Jesus as The Light!

God = Word = Life = Light ‚ú®

I‚Äôm reminded that my foundation is important. 

Starting with God daily, which is the Word will give me life even when going through difficult times. 

The life in me, which is God‚Äôs Light will dispel darkness. The Word illuminates my path and gives me a stronger perspective."

Verse 14: And the Word (God the son) came and dwelt among us. God sent His son in the form of man to dwell amongst us humans to feel what we feel and experience what we go through, to the extent of having to die for our sins. The pain of every stripe and beating was felt! What a sacrifice! Thank you Lord! Praying that the death of your son, our Lord Jesus Christ will not be in vain in our daily lives, in Jesus' name. Amen."
ZINOOBIEGBEDI@GMAIL.COM,1610946936,Thu Jan 21 2021 15:43:02 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),"John 1:4 reminds me a lot about PWA message yesterday about the boy that Jesus healed at the city gate. Since the bible says in john 1:4 that Word gives life to everything created, it only makes sense that Jesus gave life to the dead boy. In the same way when i speak the Word over dead circumstances, i should expect that situation to come back to life. #Beauty4Ashes"
