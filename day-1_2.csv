The “Law” / “Torah” (of the Old Testament), commanded cleansing with water for physical and spiritual purification.  We all know that cleanliness is both a prerequisite of holiness and an aid to physical fitness / hygiene.  \n\nBut why did Jesus use these ceremonial stone jars?\n\nHe asked them to fill the jars with “water” (John 6:7).  \n\nTwo things came to my mind here:\n\n1.) Water refreshes dryness and water brings life.  Water was (and still is) recognized for natural cleansing.  To the Jews at that time, water coming from their ceremonial cleansing jars had to be for their cleansing ritual - which occurred on the outside.  By turning the “water” from the ceremonial cleansing jars into “wine” (which is a symbol for the Holy Spirit according to Ephesians 5:18), Jesus was trying to show them (and show us) a new way.  Jesus changes the water - which washes the outer body, into the wine of the Spirit - which cleanses and regenerates internally. Jesus uses this miracle to teach us that the work of ceremonial cleansing with water could only go so far, and at best remain superficial.  But the work of cleansing by the wine of the Holy Spirit launches us to a new way of life.  Remember, John the Baptist said he baptized with water (ceremonial / traditional cleansing) but Jesus was going to baptize with the Holy Spirit (new wine) and fire.  \n\n\n2.) This work of the Holy Spirit is symbolized literally to us, as new wine coming into old earthen vessels.  \n\nThis led to a bunch of questions for me:\n\na.) If the new wine symbolizes the (work of) Holy Spirit, then it cannot stay closed in a vessel.  Despite how significant (ceremonial) or pretty the vessel is, the new wine is useless if it is not poured out to others.  The new wine in my life must be shared to fill a void / need in the lives of everyone I encounter.  The work of the Holy Spirit must me manifest in my life. \n\nb.) If there is new wine, then new wine skins are needed.  The former way of doing things must change.  What am I doing on my part to ensure that this new wine does not remain in an old vessel? What steps am I taking to transition to the new level of holiness, prayerfulness, worship, service, giving? What new approaches to my faith walk, personal life, career, relationships does God want me to embrace in 2021 and beyond?""}","{""email"":""pelumi.ola16@gmail.com"",""unix_timestamp"":1610976992,""date_created"":""Fri Jan 22 2021 19:44:26 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)"",""comment"":""I really enjoyed chapter 1.
